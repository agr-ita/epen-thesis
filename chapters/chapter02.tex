In \textbf{section 2.1} a perceptual experiment aims to disentangle the contributions of phonetic categories and acoustic details on epenthetic vowel quality. Participants are asked to report their choice of epenthetic vowel (if any) within consonant cluster in stimuli where the acoustic information contained in the cluster may be in disagreement with the identity of neighbouring vowels. Information theoretic measures allow to quantify the influence of both neighbouring phonetic categories and acoustic details.  


In \textbf{section 2.2} I investigate the possibility of predicting epenthetic vowel quality in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and Japanese (JP) using a production-based exemplar model of perception. This type of model predicts the quality of a vowel epenthesized within the cluster of a stimulus based solely on the acoustic similarity of said /CC/ cluster to /CVC/ exemplars produced by native speakers of BP or JP. From this modelling approach we can evaluate the influence of pure acoustics on effects such as default epenthetic vowel quality and modulations induced by neighbouring vowels.

\paragraph{Abstract}

This study aims to quantify the relative contributions of phonetic categories and acoustic detail on phonotactically-induced perceptual vowel epenthesis in Japanese listeners. A vowel identification task tested whether a vowel was perceived within illegal consonant clusters and, if so, which vowel was heard. Cross-spliced stimuli were used in which vowel coarticulation present in the cluster did not match the quality of the flanking vowel. Two clusters were used, /hp/ and /kp/, the former containing larger amounts of resonances of the preceding vowel. While both flanking vowel and coarticulation influenced vowel quality, the influence of coarticulation was larger, especially for /hp/.

\subsection{Introduction}
% \label{sec:Introduction}

\setlength{\parindent}{5ex}

Our auditory perceptual system is tuned to the sound system of our native language, resulting in impoverished perception of nonnative sounds and sound sequences \cite{sebastian2005}. For instance, in Japanese, a vowel can only be followed by a moraic nasal consonant or by a geminate consonant. As a consequence, Japanese listeners tend to perceive an illusory, epenthetic, \textipa{/u/} within illegal consonant clusters \cite{dupoux1999, dehaene2000, dupoux2001, monahan2009, dupoux2011, guekozIS17} and it is evident in loanword adaptation as well (e.g. the word 'sphynx' is borrowed in Japanese as /sufiNkusu/). Similar effects have been documented in other languages, with different epenthetic vowels (\textipa{/1/} in Korean \cite{kabak2007, berent2008, dejong2012}; schwa in English \cite{berent2007, davidson2012}; /i/ in Brazilian Portuguese \cite{dupoux2011, guekozIS17}; and /e/ in Spanish \cite{halle2014}). Even within languages, there sometimes is variation in the quality of the epenthetic vowel; for instance, in Japanese, the epenthetic vowel can in certain contexts be \textipa{/i/} or \textipa{/o/} \cite{mattingley2015, guekozIS17}.

The factors that determine the quality of the epenthetic vowel are still unclear. There is evidence that local acoustic cues in the form of vowel coarticulation play a role. Specifically, using artificial consonant clusters obtained by completely removing an inter-consonantal vowel, \cite{dupoux2011} found that the quality of the removed vowel -- traces of which are present in the neighboring consonants -- influences the quality of the epenthetic vowel. Other studies, however, have argued for an influence of phonological factors, such as the legality of the resulting repair at the phonotactic level \cite{mattingley2015} or the presence of phonological alternations in the language \cite{durvasula2015}. Determining the source of epenthetic vowel quality is important at a theoretical level, because it can shed light on the computational mechanisms underlying the perception of speech sounds. For instance, \cite{dupoux2011} argued that coarticulation effects cannot be accounted for by two-step models, in which the repair of illegal sequences follows that of phoneme categorization, while they are in accordance with one-step models, in which phoneme categorization takes phonotactic probabilities into account.
\footnote{Note that due to a typo the summary in the first-to-last paragraph of this article erroneously states the opposite.} 
However, \cite{dupoux2011} only assessed the presence of acoustic effects, without investigating a possible role of categorical effects. Here, our aim is to quantify the relative contributions of categorical and acoustic effects on epenthetic vowel quality by directly comparing these two types of effect. 

We focus on perceptual vowel epenthesis following \textipa{/h/}. This case is ideally suited for our objective as in Japanese loanwords these fricatives are typically adapted by adding a `copy' of the preceding vowel when they occur in a syllable coda. For instance, \textit{`Bach'}, \textit{`(van) Gogh'}, and \textit{`Ich-Roman'} are adapted as \textipa{/bah:a/}, \textipa{/goh:o/}, and \textipa{/ih:iroman/}. In work on loanword adaptations, cases of vowel copy in epenthesis have been explained as a result of the spreading of phonological features from the preceding vowel onto the epenthetic vowel (i.e., vowel harmony), for instance in Shona, Sranan, and Samoan \cite{uffmann2006}, and Sesotho \cite{rose2006}. In speech perception, however, this pattern could be based either on phonetic categories, i.e. the preceding vowel itself, or on acoustic detail, i.e. traces of this vowel that are present in /h/, as laryngeal fricatives such as \textipa{/h/} contain acoustic information relative to formants of surrounding vowels \cite{keating1988}. Using an identification task, we tease apart these two explanations by independently manipulating the categorical context in which \textipa{/h/} occurs and the acoustic realization of this segment, using cross-splicing. As a control, we also use stimuli with \textipa{/k/}, which are expected to give rise to more default \textipa{/u/}-epenthesis because they contain less coarticulation. 

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{\textit{Participants}}
%\label{ssec:subj}

Twenty-five native Japanese speakers were tested in Tokyo, Japan (mean age $24 \pm 3.5$; 13 female). All were students at Keio University, and none had lived abroad. 

\subsubsection{\textit{Stimuli}}
%\label{ssec:stim}

We constructed a set of 20 base items, 10 disyllabic ones of the form $V_{1}C_{1}C_{2}V_{1}$ and 10 matched trisyllabic ones of the form $V_{1}C_{1}V_{1}C_{2}V_{1}$, 
with $V_{1}$ a vowel in the set \textipa{/a, e, i, o, u/} (henceforth: flanking vowel), $C_{1}$ \textipa{/h/} or /k/, and $C_{2}$ a fixed consonant, /p/, e.g. \textipa{/ahpa/}, \textipa{/ekpe/, /ohopo/, /ikipi/}. Three trained phoneticians, native speakers of Dutch, American English and Argentinian Spanish, respectively, recorded all items with stress on the first syllable. All /kp/ stimuli presented release bursts. For each disyllabic item, we used one token per speaker as a natural control stimulus. By systematically replacing the $/C_{1}C_{2}/$-cluster in these items by the same cluster out of the other disyllabic items produced by the same speaker but with a different vowel, we created spliced test stimuli such as $/ah_{o}pa/$, and $/ek_{i}pe/$, where the small vowel denotes vowel coarticulation present in the consonant cluster. Similarly, by replacing the $/C_{1}C_{2}/$-cluster in the disyllabic items by the same cluster out of the second token of the same items, we created spliced control stimuli in which the vowel coarticulation matched the flanking vowel, e.g. $/ah_{a}pa/$, $/ek_{e}pe/$. We also created trisyllabic fillers in which the middle vowel either matched or mismatched the flanking vowel, e.g. \textipa{/ahapa/}, \textipa{/ekepe/}, \textipa{/ahopa/}, \textipa{/ekipe/} (these were also created by splicing, as they served as test stimuli in an experiment not reported in this article). Overall, each speaker thus contributed 40 test stimuli (5 flanking vowels x 4 vowel coarticulations x 2 consonant clusters), 20 control stimuli (5 flanking vowels x 2 consonant clusters, all both in a natural and a spliced form), and 50 fillers. Ten additional training items were recorded by a fourth speaker. Their structure was similar, but included only phonotactically legal nasal + stop sequences with or without an intervening copy vowel (e.g., \textipa{/ampa/, /enepe/}). 

\subsubsection{\textit{Procedure}}
%\label{ssec:procedure}

Participants were tested individually in a soundproof room. At each trial, they heard a stimulus over headphones and were asked to identify the vowel between the two consonants, if any. They were provided with a transcription of the item on screen, containing a question mark between the two consonants (e.g. \textit{``ah?pa"}) in latin characters (as non-CV syllables cannot be transcribed using Japanese characters), as well as the list of possible responses: \textit{``none, a, i, u, e, o"}. Participants responded by pressing labelled keys on a keyboard. Participants were familiarised with the procedure with 10 training trials in which they received on-screen feedback. 

The 330 stimuli were presented in a pseudo-randomised order: Consecutive stimuli were produced by different speakers, and a stimulus could not be followed by a stimulus with the same combination of vowel coarticulation and consonant. Trials were presented in two blocks, with each stimulus appearing once per block, for a total of 660 trials. The experiment lasted approximately 40 minutes. 

\subsection{Results}
%\label{sec:results}

Test and control trials with responses that were either too fast (before the medial portion of the stimulus could be perceived and processed, $<$400 ms) or too slow ($>$ 3 SD: 3238 ms) were excluded from the analyses. This concerned 736 trials (4.5\%).

\subsubsection{\textit{Control items}}
%\label{ssec:ctrl_items}

Participants experienced perceptual epenthesis in 57\% of control items in which the flanking vowel and coarticulation are of the same quality (/hp/: 52\%, /kp/: 61\%). Recall that in loanwords, the default epenthetic vowel is /u/, while after voiceless laryngeal fricatives it is a copy of the preceding vowel. Focusing on trials with an epenthetic response, we examined whether the choice of epenthetic vowel reflected this pattern. 

First, a generalised mixed-effects model with a declared binomial distribution \cite{lme4} was used to examine a possible effect of consonant cluster on default /u/-epenthesis. Thus, we analyzed the proportion of default \textipa{/u/}, using participant, speaker, experimental block, and trial as random effects, and consonant cluster (\textipa{/kp/} \textit{vs.} \textipa{/hp/}; contrast coded) as fixed effect. This model was compared to a reduced model with no fixed effect. The full model was found to explain significantly more variance than the reduced model ($\beta = -4.2$, $SE = 1.2$, $\chi^{2}(1) = 9.9$, $p < 0.01$), showing that participants experienced significantly less default /u/-epenthesis in \textipa{/hp/-} than \textipa{/kp/-}items (39\% \textit{vs.} 86\% of all trials with epenthesis, respectively). 

Next, we examined whether epenthesized vowels shared the quality of the flanking vowel more often in /hp/- than in /kp/-clusters. Given that for items with flanking vowel /u/ it is impossible to know if /u/-epenthesis is due to vowel copy or to default epenthesis, these items were excluded. As before, a generalised mixed-effects model with a declared binomial distribution was used. We analyzed the proportion of vowel copy (i.e., whether the flanking vowel and epenthetic vowel shared quality), using participant, speaker, experimental block, and trial as random effects, and consonant cluster (\textipa{/kp/} \textit{vs.} \textipa{/hp/}; contrast coded) as fixed effect. Comparing this full model to a reduced model with no fixed effects revealed a significant effect of consonant cluster ($\beta = 3.7$, $SE = 1.2$, $\chi^{2}(1) = 7.4$, $p < 0.01$). Therefore, participants epenthesized a vowel that matched the flanking vowel more often in /hp/-clusters (53\%) than in /kp/- clusters (13\%). 

Thus, analysis of control items revealed that, similarly to the loanword pattern, participants perceived the vowel /u/ more often in /kp/- than in /hp/-clusters, and they perceived a vowel copy more often in /hp/- than in /kp/-clusters.

\subsubsection{\textit{Test items}}
\label{ssec:test_items}

Within each rectangle, flanking vowels and vowel coarticulation are given in the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. Darker colours indicate higher counts. A figure showing counts separated by speaker can be found in the supplementary materials at https://osf.io/y9h6c}}
\label{fig:tiles}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:tiles} shows trial counts, separated according to response category, consonant cluster, flanking vowel, and vowel coarticulation for test and control trials. Within the individual rectangles, vertical lines are indicative of a larger influence of flanking vowels compared to vowel coarticulation. Horizontal lines, by contrast, are indicative of a larger influence of vowel coarticulation. Finally, uniform colouring indicates that neither flanking vowels nor vowel coarticulation have the upper hand in influencing the quality of the epenthetic vowel. Note that except for the rectangles with ``none" and ``u" responses where colouring is more uniform, horizontal lines are more visually prominent than vertical lines. Thus, the epenthetic vowel's quality generally depends mostly on acoustic details present in the consonant cluster. 

Focusing on the test trials eliciting epenthesis (/hp/: 62\%, /kp/: 66\%), we quantify the respective influence of flanking vowel and vowel coarticulation (explanatory variables, EV) on the epenthetic vowel (response variable, RV), using two measures from information theory, \textbf{mutual information} (MI) and \textbf{information gain} (IG) \cite[see][for a comprehensive description of these measures]{daland2015}. MI and IG are derived from \textbf{entropy}, which is the `uncertainty' in the value of a RV at a given trial. The lower the entropy $H[X]$ of a variable $X$, the easier it is to predict the outcome of a trial. The \textbf{MI $I[X;Y]$} of variables $X$ and $Y$ represents the reduction in `uncertainty' of the trial outcome for RV $X$, given that the value of EV $Y$ is known (and vice versa). This corresponds to the maximum amount of influence that $Y$ can have over $X$, without removing contributions from other variables. \textbf{IG $H[X|Z] - H[X|Y,Z]$} represents the minimum amount of influence of variable $Y$ on $X$. This corresponds to the reduction in uncertainty as to the value of $X$ that arises from knowing the value of $Y$, after removing all uncertainty explained by variable $Z$. 

As in \cite{daland2015}, we compute \textbf{accidental information} introduced to MI and IG, which corresponds to inaccuracies introduced to our measurements by the process of inferring underlying probability distributions from samples, i.e., sampling error (as when one does not obtain 50 tails and 50 heads when flipping a fair coin 100 times).
We can estimate the accidental information by recomputing MI and IG after having removed the dependencies between the EV and the RV. We can do so by shuffling the values of the EV within each participant. For instance, in order to compute the accidental information introduced to MI and IG for the EV ``vowel coarticulation'', we randomly shuffle the vowel coarticulation labels of all of our trials, per participant, while leaving the EV ``flanking vowel'' untouched. We then compute MI and IG as for the real data. In order to obtain a better estimate of accidental information from an average value, we do this 1000 times (i.e., Monte Carlo shuffling process). 

To recapitulate, for both coarticulation vowel and flanking vowel, we compute `sample' and `accidental' MI and IG. The `true' values of these measures are obtained by removing mean accidental information from sample information. Following \cite{daland2015}, we consider the set of shuffled datasets (i.e., `accidental' MI and IG) as probability distributions given by the null hypotheses that neither coarticulation nor the flanking vowel influence the responses.

  \end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

As shown in Table \ref{infoth}, all sample lower bounds are greater than their respective accidental information gains on all 1000 shufflings, for which the ranges are given in parentheses. Therefore, the `true' lower bounds for both coarticulation and flanking vowel influence on epenthesis are greater than $0$ with $p<0.001$, showing that both coarticulation and flanking vowel quality influence participant responses. However, the amount of influence differs greatly: a larger information gain is yielded by considering vowel coarticulation  %29- and 11-times
than by considering the flanking vowel. This is true both for /hp/-items, which are heavily coarticulated, and for /kp/-items, where coarticulation is mainly only present in the burst, even though the influence of coarticulation on epenthetic vowel quality is higher for the former (/hp/: $[0.86, 0.92]$ \textit{vs.} /kp/: $[0.44, 0.52]$). (The range of variation within shuffles of accidental information was about .03; thus any difference of .06 or bigger is significant, including differences between MI and IG values, respectively). In summary, both vowel coarticulation and the flanking vowel influence epenthetic vowel quality, but this influence is greater for vowel coarticulation; response patterns are more predictable when the value of this variable is known than when the value of the flanking vowel variable is known. 

\subsection{Discussion and conclusion}
%\label{sec:concl}

We used an identification task to assess the quality of epenthetic vowels perceived by Japanese listeners in illegal consonant clusters with varying amounts of coarticulation. Our findings can be summarized as follows: First, we were able to replicate the perception of illusory vowels within phonotactically illegal clusters by Japanese listeners (64\% of all test trials).\footnote{Note that whereas previous studies examined perceptual epenthesis within clusters with at least one voiced consonant, we presently focused on completely voiceless clusters, a context in which the high vowels /i/ and /u/ may be devoiced in Japanese \cite{han1962, vance1987}}\footnote{As pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, the differences in rates of epenthesis by speaker (Dutch: 68\%, Am. English: 58\%, Arg. Spanish: 66\%) are consistent with an important role for acoustic factors in epenthesis, suggesting that participants interpret speakers' acoustic cues instead of responding based on abstract phonological categories \cite[cf.][]{wilson2014}. This can also be seen in more detail when decomposing Figure \ref{fig:tiles} by speaker, as in supplementary materials available from https://osf.io/y9h6c}
Second, when the flanking vowel and coarticulation match, the quality of the perceived vowel patterned in the same way as in loanword adaptation data. That is, for \textipa{/kp/}-clusters, the predominant epenthetic vowel was the standard default vowel for Japanese (\textipa{/u/}), while for \textipa{/hp/}-clusters, it was a copy of the flanking vowel. Finally, and most importantly, in items where the coarticulation and flanking vowel differed, the quality of the epenthetic vowel was significantly influenced by both variables, but the influence of the former was much larger than that of the latter, especially in the case of /hp/. Our discussion focuses on this last finding. 

Before discussing its theoretical relevance, let us comment on the numerically small -- yet significant -- influence of flanking vowel on epenthesis for \textipa{/hp/}-clusters, where vowel coarticulation is maximal. This result suggests a contribution of categorical variables on epenthetic vowel quality (i.e., copy effect). A similar effect, though, was also found for \textipa{/kp/}-clusters, for which loanword adaptation patterns provide no particular reason to propose the existence of a categorical copy phenomenon; indeed, in loanwords, coda-/k/ generally triggers default /u/-epenthesis. 
Therefore, it is possible that this effect results from a response bias due to task demands: given a perceptually uncertain stimulus, the flanking vowel could prime a `copy' response, for instance, because it was visually available on-screen at each trial (e.g. ``ah?pa"). Further work using different tasks is necessary to examine the perceptual reality of this `vowel copy' effect. 

Keeping in mind that this work focuses on the choice of epenthetic vowel, while not directly addressing questions related to why phonologically-illegal clusters are repaired, or what the role of phonotactics in epenthesis is, the finding that the quality of the epenthetic vowel is influenced more by coarticulation than by the flanking vowel calls for a perceptual repair mechanism in which acoustic details are taken into consideration. Two-step models in which epenthetic repair is performed after the consonant cluster in the acoustic input has been represented in terms of discrete phonetic categories are therefore ruled out. Rather, like \cite{dupoux2011}, we argue in favor of one-step models, in which epenthetic vowel quality is based on the similarity between local acoustic cues and prototypical properties of each vowel in the language, such that the closest matching vowel gets selected for insertion. This mechanism can account both for the coarticulation-induced vowel copy effect in items with a \textipa{/hp/}-cluster, as the voiceless glottal fricative /h/ contains strong coarticulation from the adjacent vowels \cite[][also see https://osf.io/y9h6c for supplementary data]{keating1988}, and for the default /u/-epenthesis effect in items with a \textipa{/kp/}-cluster -- which exhibit a lower degree of coarticulation -- as \textipa{/u/} is the phonetically shortest vowel in the language \cite{han1962} and is prone to be devoiced in certain contexts (see footnote).

Focusing on cases where the quality of the epenthetic vowel varies \textit{within language} as a function of the type of cluster, previous studies have investigated whether language-specific phonotactic or phonological properties play a role for the quality of the epenthetic vowel. In Japanese, for instance, dental stops cannot be followed by /u/, and in loanwords this phonotactic constraint gives rise to adaptation by means of /o/-epenthesis (e.g. $'batman' \rightarrow 'batoman'$). Using identification tasks, both \cite{mattingley2015} and \cite{guekozIS17} report that the perceptual equivalent of this effect is only marginally present in Japanese listeners \cite[10-12\% of /o/-epenthesis in /d/-initial clusters; see also][for the absence of such an effect in a discrimination task]{monahan2009}. Thus, so far there is only weak evidence that the mechanism of phonotactic repair takes into account the legality of the resulting CVC-sequence. A stronger effect of cluster-dependent perceptual epenthesis has been reported in Korean listeners, who repair \textipa{/eSma/} and -- to a lesser extent -- \textipa{/ec\super hma/} with an epenthetic \textipa{/i/} instead of the default epenthetic vowel \textipa{/1/} \cite{durvasula2015}. This is argued to be due to the existence of an allophonic rule that palatalizes \textipa{/s/} and \textipa{/t\super h/} before \textipa{/i/}, yielding \textipa{[Si]} and \textipa{[c\super hi]}, respectively. It is also possible, however, that this effect is (partly) due to coarticulation; for instance, acoustic cues in \textipa{/S/} and \textipa{/c\super h/} might be more suggestive of \textipa{/i/} than of \textipa{/1/}.  

To conclude, we directly compared the relative contributions of acoustic and categorical effects on epenthetic vowel quality, and found that the former override the latter. This result thus strengthens those of \cite{dupoux2011}, who also established the presence of acoustic effects but without investigating possible categorical effects. More research is needed to investigate whether our findings generalize to other cases of perceptual epenthesis. This question can be addressed by two complementary approaches. One would be to run additional experiments with cross-spliced stimuli, as in the present study. Another one would be to measure the effective amount of coarticulation in experimental stimuli of previous studies, using a computational implementation of a one-step repair mechanism (see \cite{dupoux2011} and \cite{wilson2014} for propositions, and \cite{schatz2016} for an implementation using Hidden Markov Models).

% [TODO] Add correlation results
We also performed a control ABX task with a different set of participants, as this task promotes a more global perception of the stimuli. In this experiment, participants heard trials with 4 types of AB pairs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V_1CpV_1$ (non-spliced cluster) vs. $V_1CV_1pV_1$ (full vowel)
    \item $V_1CpV_1$ (non-spliced cluster) vs. $V_1C_{V_2}pV_1$ (spliced cluster)
    \item $V_1C_{V_2}pV_1$ (spliced cluster) vs. $V_1C_{V_3}pV_1$ (spliced cluster)
    \item $V_1C_{V_2}pV_1$ (spliced cluster) vs. $V_1CV_2pV_1$ (full vowel)
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

We saw that ABX accuracy rates for each pair were correlated with how similar response patterns for items A and B were at the identification task. In other words, the more similar response patterns were for A and B at the identification task, the harder it was for participants to discriminate A and B at the ABX task. \\

Similarity of responses was assessed by computing the Euclidean distance between 6-dimensional vectors [$p_{none}$, $p_a$, $p_e$, $p_i$, $p_o$, $p_u$] of A and B, where $p_x$ corresponds to the proportion of total trials for A (or B) in which participants responded $x$. These results suggest that adaptation patterns attested in the identification task are not task-dependent.

\paragraph{Abstract}
Past research has shown that sound sequences not permitted in our native language may be distorted by our perceptual system. A well-documented example is vowel epenthesis, a phenomenon by which listeners hallucinate non-existent vowels within illegal consonantal sequences. As reported in previous work, this occurs for instance in Japanese (JP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP), languages for which the `default' epenthetic vowels are /u/ and /i/, respectively. In a perceptual experiment, we corroborate the finding that the quality of this illusory vowel is language-dependent, but also that this default choice can be overridden by coarticulatory information present on the consonant cluster. In a second step, we analyse recordings of JP and BP speakers producing `epenthesized' versions of stimuli from the perceptual task. Results reveal that the default vowel corresponds to the vowel with the most reduced acoustic characteristics and whose formants are acoustically closest to formant transitions present in consonantal clusters. Lastly, we model behavioural responses from the perceptual experiment with an exemplar model using dynamic time warping (DTW)-based similarity measures on MFCCs. 

\subsection{Introduction}

When languages borrow words from one another, the borrowed words tend to be adapted to the local phonology. For instance, Brazilian Portuguese phonotactic constraints disallow most obstruent-obstruent and obstruent-nasal sequences, while those of Japanese disallow consonant clusters and consonants in coda position (with the exception of geminates and nasal consonants). Foreign words containing these illegal sequences may be broken up by the insertion of so-called `epenthetic' vowels (e.g., BP: "football" $\rightarrow$ \textipa{/futibol/}, JP: "ice cream" $\rightarrow$ \textipa{/aisukuri:mu/}). This phenomenon has been shown to also happen during on-line perception: listeners \textit{perceive} vowels within illegal consonantal sequences \cite{dupoux_1999, dehaene_2000, dupoux_2001, berent2007, kabak2007, monahan2009, dupoux_2011, mattingley2015, durvasula2015}. This suggests that phonotactic constraints of the native language play an active role during speech perception and induce repair of illegal forms such that they are recoded into the nearest legal one. The specific mechanisms of this repair process are still largely unknown. In particular, what determines the quality of the epenthesized vowel? Past work has shown that perceptual epenthesis is language-dependent (e.g., /i/ in BP, /u/ in JP), but also that it may be influenced by local acoustic properties, i.e., by coarticulation \cite{dupoux_2011}. Here, we study these two effects together, and report, firstly, on a perception experiment with BP and JP listeners. Next, we conduct acoustic analyses of the production of possible epenthetic vowels in a subset of the same participants.
Lastly, we present an exemplar-based computational model of speech perception which attempts to model phonotactic repairs based on acoustics.

\subsection{Perception experiment}

We assess patterns of perceptual epenthesis by BP and JP native listeners on stimuli containing an illegal cluster. We investigate (1) the preferred epenthetic vowel in the two languages (/i/ vs. /u/), and (2) the influence of flanking vowels on responses.    

\subsubsection{Methods}

Fifty-four items with the structure $V_{1}C_{1}C_{2}V_{2}$, with $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ vowels from the set \{/a/, /i/, /u/\}, and $C_{1}C_{2}$ a cluster from the set \{/bg/, /bn/, /db/, /dg/, /gb/, /gn/\}, e.g. /abgi/, were recorded by a native speaker of French. Twenty-two native BP listeners and 17 native JP listeners were tested in S\~{a}o Paulo and Tokyo, respectively. None had extensive exposure to languages that allow complex consonantal clusters. At each trial, participants heard a stimulus and had to indicate within 3 seconds which vowel from the set \{/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/ and \textit{none}\} they perceived within the consonant cluster. 

\subsubsection{Results}
Statistical analyses were performed with the R statistical software \cite{R-base}, using MCMC glmm \cite{R-MCMCglmm, R-coda}. Effects were considered statistically significant if the 95\% highest posterior density (HPD) interval estimated for the variable of interest did not include zero. Please note that we only report effects relevant to hypotheses tested in this work. A full report of all analyses conducted in this paper (as well as additional information) can be found in: https://osf.io/zr88w/.

In order to assess the influence of $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ (henceforth: flanking vowels) on epenthetic vowel quality (/i/ or /u/), we fitted models with fixed effects Language (BP \textit{vs.} JP), Number of Same Flanking Vowels (NSFV) ($none$ \textit{vs.} $1$; $none$ and $1$ \textit{vs.} $2$) and their interaction, with Participants as random effect. We also included the fixed effect Coronal $C_{1}$ (non-coronal \textit{vs.} coronal) and the resulting interactions when analysing /u/ responses, as the insertion of default /u/ after coronal consonants yields phonotactically illegal sequences in Japanese. Fixed effects were contrast coded with deviance coding and, in the case of the trinomial variable NSFVs, comparisons were achieved by creating dummy variables "none \textit{vs} 1" with weights [-0.5, 0.5, 0] for levels $none$, $1$ and $2$, respectively, and "Less than 2 \textit{vs.} 2" with weights [-0.25, -0.25, 0.5] for levels $none$, $1$ and $2$. 

Overall, BP and JP participants experienced vowel epenthesis in 81\% and 87\% of the trials, respectively. We focus our analysis on these trials and, in order to allow for comparisons with the model from Section 4 below, we exclude trials for which the reported epenthetic vowel was /a/ (1\%) or /e/ (BP: 1\%, JP: 3\%). Percentages for the remaining responses of interest (/i/, /o/, and /u/) can be seen in the lefthand part of Table~\ref{tab:model_overall}.

\subsubsection{/i/-epenthesis}

A main effect of Language shows that BP participants perceived an epenthetic /i/ more often than JP participants (posterior mode: $-277.1$, HPD interval: $[-389.2, -167.1]$). Moreover, the propensity to respond /i/ was influenced by flanking vowels, as indicated by a main effect of NSFV: Participants gave more /i/ responses when one flanking vowel was /i/ ($204.1, [80.8, 283.7]$), and even more so when both flanking vowels were /i/ ($368.9, [208.4, 443.4]$). 

\paragraph{/u/-epenthesis}

We found a main effect of Language; BP participants epenthesized /u/ less often than JP participants ($265.2, [191.0, 347.2]$). The significant main effect of NSFV shows that participants were overall more prone to perceiving an epenthetic /u/ if one ($137.0, [90.6, 185.4]$) or both ($300.3, [230.4, 387.7]$) flanking vowels were /u/. Lastly, there was also a main effect of Coronal $C_{1}$ ($-43.0, [-75.8, -9.8]$): participants perceived /u/ less often after coronal than after labial and velar consonants. However, neither the interaction between Coronal $C_{1}$ and Language ($-63.9, [-132.1, 3.0]$), nor the triple interactions with NSFV ($-17.8, [-124.9, 84.1]$, $-14.8, [-238.4, 304.3$) were significant; thus, JP participants were not more prone to avoiding /u/-epenthesis after coronal consonants than BP participants.

\subsection{Acoustic analyses}

In both BP and JP, the shortest vowel corresponds to the default epenthetic vowel, i.e. /i/ in BP \cite{escudero2009} and /u/ in JP \cite{han1962}. Here, we compare epenthetic vowels /i/, /u/, and /o/ on three acoustic parameters: (1) vowel duration, (2) vowel intensity, and (3) Euclidean distance between vowel formants and formant transitions in consonant clusters. We hypothesize that, for both languages, the default vowel is the one (1) that is shortest, (2) that has the lowest intensity, and (3) whose formants are closest to the formant transitions present in consonantal clusters.       

\subsubsection{Methods}

Seventeen BP and 17 JP participants from the perception experiment were also recorded producing 162 stimuli obtained by crossing the 54 $V_{1}C_{1}\_C_{2}V_{2}$ frames of the experimental items with the three vowels /i/, /o/, and /u/ (e.g. $/ab\_gi/ \rightarrow /abigi/, /abogi/, /abugi/$).
Items were read aloud in carrier sentences, with stress and pitch accent on the first syllable for BP and JP speakers, respectively. The recordings were manually segmented and transcribed by a trained phonetician. Recordings with errors or unwanted noise were excluded from the analyses. Acoustic measurements were automatically extracted from the speech signal using the R package wrassp \cite{R-wrassp}.

\subsubsection{Results}

For each of the continuous response variables examined in this section, we fitted an MCMC glmm with fixed effects Language (BP \textit{vs.} JP), Medial Vowel (/i/ \textit{vs.} /u/; /i/ and /u/ \textit{vs.} /o/) and their interaction, with Participant and Item as random effects. Fixed effects were contrast coded with deviance coding and, in the case of the trinomial variable Medial Vowel, the comparisons were achieved by creating a dummy variable "/i/ \textit{vs} /u/" with weights [-0.5, 0, 0.5] for levels /i/, /o/ and /u/, respectively, and one for "High Vowels \textit{vs.} /o/" with weights [-0.25, 0.5, -0.25]. Multiple pairwise comparisons, using Least Squares Means (LSMEANS) and Tukey's adjustment, were performed using the R package lsmeans \cite{R-lsmeans}.

\paragraph{Vowel duration}

The measured duration of each medial vowel $V_{3}$ (in seconds) was log-transformed to account for distribution skewness. We found a main effect of Medial Vowel ("/i/ \textit{vs} /u/": $0.04$, $[0.02, 0.06]$; "High Vowels \textit{vs.} /o/": $0.32$, $[0.30, 0.34]$), showing that, overall, /o/ is longer than /u/, which is longer than /i/. The interaction of Language and Medial Vowel was also significant ("/i/ \textit{vs} /u/": $-0.15$, $[-0.18, -0.10]$), reflecting the fact that in BP, /i/ is shorter than /u/ (mean /i/: $57.2$ ms; mean /u/: $64.5$ ms; adjusted $p<0.05$) while in JP, /u/ is shorter than /i/ (mean /u/: $69.6$ ms; mean /i/: $72.0$ ms; adjusted $p<0.05$).

\paragraph{Vowel intensity}

We compared the mean intensity of the medial vowels $V_{3}$ in decibels (dB). There was a main effect of Medial Vowel, with /i/ having on average lower intensity than /u/ ($0.8$, $[0.7, 1.1]$), and high vowels having lower intensity than /o/ ($2.1$, $[1.9, 2.4]$). Of interest is the fact that the former effect is larger for JP than for BP (Language x "/i/ \textit{vs} /u/": $0.38$, $[0.09, 0.90]$), meaning that while /i/ is the vowel with least intensity in BP (mean: $72.8$ dB \textit{vs.} $73.2$ for /u/; adjusted $p<0.05$), the reverse is not true for JP (mean: $69.7$ dB for /u/ \textit{vs.} $68.7$ for /i/, adjusted $p<0.05$).
This might be due to an overall higher degree of vocal constriction during the production of /i/ compared to /u/.  

\paragraph{Vowel formants}

We extracted median formant values (F1, F2, and F3, in Bark) from medial vowels $V_{3}$ and computed their Euclidean distance to the transitions found within their respective clusters (e.g. the /i/ in /abiga/ was compared to transitions in /bg/ from the French recording of /abga/). These Euclidean distances were square-root transformed to account for skewness. There was a main effect of Medial Vowel, as on average distance was shorter for /u/ than for /i/ ($-0.06$, $[-0.08, -0.04]$), while it was longer for /o/ relative to both /i/ and /u/ ($0.28$, $[0.25, 0.30]$). Of interest is the significant interaction between Language and Medial Vowel "/i/ \textit{vs} /u/" ($-0.31$, $[-0.36, -0.28]$), reflecting the fact that in BP /i/ formants were closer to cluster transitions than /u/ formants (mean: /i/ $2.8$ \textit{vs.} /u/ $3.1$, adjusted $p<0.05$), while the reverse held in JP (mean: /i/ $2.9$ \textit{vs.} /u/ $2.2$, adjusted $p<0.05$).

\subsection{Production-based exemplar model}

We built an exemplar model of the perception of phonotactically illegal consonant clusters by BP and JP listeners, exclusively based on acoustics. We used all participants' productions from Section 3 as the inventory of exemplars available to our model. This is a simple way of representing the acoustics that a BP/JP native listener may have been exposed to during language development. As an analogy to the perception experiment from Section 2, the model classified each $V_{1}C_{1}C_{2}V_{2}$ template as $V_{1}C_{1}iC_{2}V_{2}$, $V_{1}C_{1}oC_{2}V_{2}$, or $V_{1}C_{1}uC_{2}V_{2}$, based on the similarity of the template to exemplars of these three categories available in the inventory. We examined whether the model was able to predict participants' epenthetic patterns, in particular, whether it was able to mimic preferences for default vowels and capture the modulation of these preferences induced by flanking vowels.   

\subsubsection{Methods}
Recordings from Section 3 were converted into sequences of 39-dimensional feature vectors consisting of 12 Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and energy features, with delta and delta-delta coefficients. Coefficient values were standardised. We computed the optimal alignment between all $V_{1}C_{1}C_{2}V_{2}$ templates (e.g. /abgi/) and their corresponding $V_{1}C_{1}V_{3}C_{2}V_{2}$ epenthesized versions (e.g. /abigi/, /abogi/, /abugi/) using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) \cite{sakoe1978, R-dtw}. In order to ensure that the resulting distances were not mainly influenced by spectral differences of flanking vowels $V_{1}$ and $V_{3}$, we only compared $C_{1}C_{2}$ clusters to $C_{1}V_{3}C_{2}$ sections. Note, however, that coarticulation cues from flanking vowels are expected to be present within the clusters. 

For the simulation, we built a classifier that assigns any given template to one category in the set \{$V_{1}C_{1}iC_{2}V_{2}$, $V_{1}C_{1}oC_{2}V_{2}$, $V_{1}C_{1}uC_{2}V_{2}$\}, based on acoustic similarity. Similarity $s$ between templates and epenthesized versions was defined as
% 
\begin{equation}
  s = e^{-cd}
  \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
% 
where $d$ is the DTW distance, and $c$ is a parameter determining the weight of the DTW distance on classification \cite{nosofsky1992}. When $c = 0$, DTW is disregarded and all possible classification categories are equally probable. Higher values of $c$ result in higher probabilities being given to items with smaller $d$. In order to control for unequal number of tokens in each category, classification was performed by computing the mean similarity within each category. From there we sampled a classification label weighting category probabilities by the resulting mean similarity weights. Parameter $c$ was individually optimised for each language by performing leave-one-out cross-validation (maximum accuracy: $0.50$ with $c = 0.5$ for BP, and $0.63$ with $c = 2.2$ for JP; chance level at $0.33$). 

\subsubsection{Results}

The same statistical models from Section 2, but without a random effect for Participant, were used.

The perception model was able to accurately predict participant responses for 59.1\% (BP) and 58.4\% (JP) of trials. Figure~\ref{fig:per&model_responses} shows a detailed distribution of the responses. As shown in the righthand part of Table~\ref{tab:model_overall}, the model rarely predicted /o/ responses, as expected based on acoustic analyses; however, it is surprising that most /o/ responses were predicted for BP rather than for JP. This might be due to overlap of /u/ and /o/ in the formant space of BP, which is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:prod_formants}.
Concerning /i/ and /u/, numerically the model predicted more /i/ responses than /u/ responses for BP, and the opposite for JP. However, these differences are not as clear as they are for our human data, where in both languages the default vowel is chosen four times more often than the non-default high vowel.  

\paragraph{/i/-epenthesis}

We found a main effect of Language ($-52.0$, $[-86.9, -23.8$) and a main effect of NSFV ($none$ \textit{vs.} $1$: $93.3$, $[53.0, 125.0]$; Less than $2$ \textit{vs.} $2$: $245.7$, $[150.8, 328.2]$). 
Thus, our model is able to reflect the higher frequency of /i/ as epenthetic vowel in BP compared to JP participants, as well as the influence of flanking vowels on /i/-epenthesis in both BP and JP. 

\paragraph{/u/-epenthesis}

We found a main effect of NSFV ($none$ \textit{vs.} $1$: $37.8$, $[16.0, 62.3]$; Less than $2$ \textit{vs.} $2$: $190.7$, $[131.0, 240.6]$) but not of Language ($-15.9$, $[-50.2, 10.1]$). Thus, while our model was able to qualitatively reproduce the influence of flanking vowels on epenthetic vowel quality for /u/, it was unable to reflect the fact that JP listeners perceive /u/ more often than BP listeners. 

There was also a main effect for Coronal $C_{1}$ ($-66.7$, $[-95.6, -39.5]$) but no interaction of this effect with Language ($40.2, [-28.0, 91.8]$); similarly to the perception data, this reflects an overall lower propensity for the model to `epenthesize' /u/ after coronal consonants. 
The triple interaction NSFV x Coronal $C_{1}$ x Language was significant for both "levels" of NSFV ($94.1, [19.9, 210.6]$, $525.8, [275.5, 666.1]$). Closer inspection suggests that this reflected the model's inability to predict higher percentages of /u/-responses by both BP and JP participants after coronal consonants when both flanking vowels were /u/. 

\subsection{General Discussion}

Examining epenthetic vowel quality preferences by BP and JP speakers in a perception task, we corroborated previous findings (\cite{dupoux_1999, dupoux_2011}) that, like in loanword adaptations, the default epenthetic vowel during speech perception is /i/ for BP and /u/ for JP. Our acoustic analyses suggest that the choice of epenthetic vowel is acoustically driven. That is, in BP, /i/ is shorter and spectrally closer to the formant transitions in our stimuli than /u/ (and /o/), while the reverse holds in Japanese. As such, it may not be necessary to rely on phonological explanations of epenthetic vowel quality as in \cite{rose2006, uffmann2006}, were we to find that these are shared characteristics of default epenthetic vowels in a variety of languages. We also found an influence of flanking vowels on epenthetic vowel quality, similar to what was reported in \cite{dupoux_2011}. Indeed, participants gave fewer default responses when the quality of the flanking vowels was in disagreement with the default choice, resulting in more "vowel copy" epenthesis (i.e. perceiving a vowel of the same quality as that of a flanking vowel). Furthermore, we found that this effect of flanking vowels is additive, as it is even more prominent when both flanking vowels are of the same quality.

Interestingly, phonotactics did not influence JP participants' responses as may have been expected; while /o/ was almost exclusively perceived after coronal consonants, this was almost always the case for stimuli with $V_{1} = /a/$ (cf Figure~\ref{fig:per&model_responses}). In fact, for all combinations of flanking vowels, participants responded /i/ and/or /u/ more often than /o/ in coronal contexts, even though both /du/ and /di/ are phonotactically illegal sequences in JP. These results, which are reminiscent of previous work \cite{monahan2009, mattingley2015}, suggest that constraints on perception given by surface phonotactics can be overruled by constraints relative to matching input acoustics \cite{dupoux_2011}. In fact, if this were not the case, novel sound sequences would have never arisen in JP loanwords (e.g. \textit{party} is adapted as \textipa{/pa:ti/}, not \textipa{/pa:tCi/}). 

Finally, we presented one exemplar model per language, based on productions by BP and JP participants, respectively. These models reproduced the major effects found in the perception experiment --- namely, the preferred epenthetic vowel, and some significant effects of language and flanking vowels --- although with a high level of noise. This noise level may be due to the relatively low number of tokens that were available as exemplars, the fact that the DTW procedure removes temporal cues (recall that we found that default vowels tend to be of shorter duration), and/or the fact that MFCC features do not appropriately capture speaker invariance.
We interpret the results as providing a proof of principle that some of the salient effects regarding perceptual epenthesis can be accounted for on purely acoustic grounds. Future research is needed to improve on the model, whose predictions deviated from the perceptual data on several counts (e.g., 6\% /o/-epenthesis for BP, but less than 1\% for JP; failure to produce more /u/-epenthesis for JP than BP). These improvements could involve more phonetically and/or temporally informed features (e.g., spectrotemporal representations \cite{chi2005}), state-of-the art large-scale approaches with HMM or DNN systems, or physiologically-inspired models of speech perception (e.g., based on cortical oscillations \cite{hyafil2015}).

To conclude, a triple approach combining perception experiments, acoustic analyses, and modeling allows us to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying perceptual epenthesis, and, more generally, repairs of illegal phonological structure during speech perception.

\item Inability to model lack of epenthesis -> Yet we see in both sections 2.1 and 2.2 that a significant percentage of responses are ``none''
\end{itemize}

%% Limitations / Remaining questions %%
Going further from epVqual 

\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on effect of acoustics on quality; not denying role of phonology (e.g., phonotactics) on misperception of nonnative clusters 
\item Our results (+ Dup2011) match one-step better than two-step => implementation with more complex one-step model (e.g., HMM using ASR tools)
%\item 
\end{itemize}
