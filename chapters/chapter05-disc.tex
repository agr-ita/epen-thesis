%% Summary (how does it answer to the issues mentioned in the introduction? How does it not?) + future avenues

- What did we do

\section{One-step vs. two-step}


\section{Importance of modelling}

\paragraph{Quantitative approach}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item This thesis == POC: introduce methodology for testing theories, but need more power 
   \item Automatisation of the process of making items from corpora (either for identification task or for ABX task) $\rightarrow$ test subjects in mass (e.g., Mechanical Turk)? 
\item cf Appendix for example of corpus ABX task
  \end{itemize} 

\section{Future avenues}

\paragraph{ASR system}
\begin{itemize}
\item Native performance not state-of-the-art (accuracy in control items not at 100\%). Influence on results?
\item Influence of using forced-alignment instead of manual alignments?
\item Input features?
  \item Corpus quality? Transcriptions are not phonetic (e.g., katakana, building from gold lexicon, ...)
  \end{itemize}


\paragraph{Paradigm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identification task $\rightarrow$ metalinguistic. How to model A(B)X task with our models?
  \end{itemize}

% “It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly, one begins to twist the facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.” – Sherlock Holmes

%It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong. Richard P. Feynman
