\paragraph{Paradigm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identification task $\rightarrow$ metalinguistic. How to model A(B)X task with our models?
  \end{itemize}

\paragraph{ASR system}
\begin{itemize}
\item Native performance not state-of-the-art (accuracy in control items not at 100\%). Influence on results?
\item Influence of using forced-alignment instead of manual alignments?
\item Input features?
  \end{itemize}

 \paragraph{Quantitative approach}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item This thesis == POC: introduce methodology for testing theories, but need more power 
   \item Automatisation of the process of making items from corpora (either for identification task or for ABX task) $\rightarrow$ test subjects in mass (e.g., Mechanical Turk)? 
\item cf Appendix for example of corpus ABX task
  \end{itemize}
